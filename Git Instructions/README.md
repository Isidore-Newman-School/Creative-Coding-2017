# Overview

This section will cover the basics of setting up Git, using the command line, and submitting assignments. If at any point you would like clarity or additional information, please ask Google or check out this [great resource for Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## What is Git / GitHub?
* **Git** is a "version control system" meaning that it keeps snapshots (or "commits") of your code throughout the development process in order to go back in time if necessary. Think of Git as the "track changes" functionality of Google Docs applied to coding.
* [**GitHub**](https://github.com) is a webpage on which you can publish your Git repositories and collaborate with other people. Think of GitHub as glorified Google Drive for programmers.

We will use Git to track code changes *locally* and GitHub to submit code or collaborate *online*.
