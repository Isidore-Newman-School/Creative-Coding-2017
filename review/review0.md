**(0)** What is the value of x after the draw() has run three times? Put a comment next to each line of code with the value of x or y at that line.

```javascript
var x = 4;          

function setup() {
  var y = x;         // y =
  x = x * 4;         // x =
  x += y;            // x =
  x *= 1;            // x =
}

function draw() {
 x++;              // after 3 runs of draw(), x =
}

```
