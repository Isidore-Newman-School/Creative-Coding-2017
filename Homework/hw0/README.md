To submit this assignment:
* You may submit answers using a text file, p5 project, or README.md. 
* Save your document(s) in a folder **HW0, which should be a subdirectory of your Git repo.** 
* Make sure you have **pushed your Git repo to GitHub**.

## Variables

**(1)** In the following code, what is printed to the console? For the quiz, be prepared to answer this type of question with pencil and paper. (Pro tip: create a table and use it to track the values of x and y at each line of code) 

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 1;
x = x + x + y;
y = x * 2;
x = 5;
y++;
console.log(x + y);
```

**(2)** So far we've looked at three types of variables: numbers (-13.7), strings ("hello!"), and booleans (true/ false). Give 2 examples of built-in p5 variables that are numbers and 2 built-in p5 variables that are booleans. (Hint: check the "Events" section of the [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Events))


## Functions

**(3)** Write a function **madLib()** that takes 4 strings (noun, adjective, verb, noun), creates a story, and prints the story to the console.

**(4)** Write a function **square()** that takes a single argument and *returns* the square of that number.

## Conditionals

**(5)** Write a function **myNameIsBetter()** that takes an argument and checks if it's equal to your name. If so, it prints to the console, "We have the same name!!" Otherwise, it prints, "[your name here] is cooler than [input name here]".

## Loops

**(6)** Use a for loop to create the following image. Try to use variables rather than numbers. The exact size isn't necessary (I'm looking for conceptual understanding).

Hint: Break this problem down into discrete steps. If you're struggling, come talk to Ms. deBB!
