# Node http-server

An alternative is node.js http-server. It is much faster than python simple server while requiring a little bit of setup. Just 3 simple steps:

1.  [Download and Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt
3.  On OSX/Linux type

        sudo npm install -g http-server

    On Windows type (you might need to open the command prompt as admin)

        npm install -g http-server

Done!

From then on just `cd` to the folder that has the files you want to serve and type

    http-server

Then point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/`
